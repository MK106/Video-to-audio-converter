# Video-to-audio-converter
A python script to convert video files into mp3 audio files


### Requirements:


#####**This script needs Python 3+**

If you don't have Python 3 installed, you just need to install python3 package :

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3
```

### Usage:

```bash
$ python video_to_audio.py <filename>
```

To fix: You can convert videos without any special characters in their names as of now. Need to fix it to accept any file name
